# Freshman.edge_project
An online pharmacy, easy to access, that prescribes medicine to common illnesses such as coughing with phlegm, coughing with allergies, high fever, toothache, and many more. This project will ask you to type down the number that corresponds to your illness, asks for your age, and then recommend the medication needed along with the dosage, it will also provide you a random fact about the human body. For example, the patient deals with coughing alongside phlegm, if the age is in the range of 0-6yrs, 2.5ml of Prospan Syrup twice a day is recommended; fun fact: 2% of the world's population has green eyes. Since it is a basic online pharmacy created by a student, do not expect to see advanced medications that are only given in the case consulted by a doctor. Thank you!
